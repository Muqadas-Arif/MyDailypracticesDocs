# Muqadas-Arif.github.io

This repository contains a small personal portfolio/resume website for Muqadas-Arif (data analyst). The site is a static HTML/CSS project based on a simple responsive layout and is intended to be published with GitHub Pages at https://Muqadas-Arif.github.io

How to update locally:
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/Muqadas-Arif/MyDailypracticesDocs.git
2. Make changes to `index.html` or files in `css/` and commit.
3. Push to GitHub:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update site"
   git push

Publishing notes:
- This will be served as a project site at https://Muqadas-Arif.github.io/MyDailypracticesDocs if you enable GitHub Pages for the repository. Go to Settings -> Pages and select branch `main` (root) to publish.

Next steps (I can do for you):
- Deploy a Streamlit demo and link it from the Projects section.
- Add real project repository links and screenshots.
- Configure a custom domain (if you have one).

Thank you.
